# DoScal

It is an open source network stress testing and denial-of-service attack application, written in Pascal.
To compile you must have [PascalABC.NET](http://pascalabc.net/), to run [.NET Framework](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download).

Now there are two types of attack. Over time, they will be more.

In fact this program is written just for fun.
Good luck!
